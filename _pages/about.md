I am an Environmental Engineer currently working in Precision Agriculture research as a Scientific-Technical Officer at the Department of Agricultural Sciences at  University of Naples Federico II.

My expertise ranges from wastewater treatment to sensors and everything in between: computer science, electronics, artificial intelligence, IoT, mechanics, robotics, and more...

Outside of Academia, I am an enthusiastic MTBer, bikepacker and traveler, a faithful husband and a caring father.
